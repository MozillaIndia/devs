**Pre-requisites**: A computer, Internet, know how to open command line.

Imagine you have a program. A simple script called `helloworld.cpp`.

It is working quite as intended and you're completely happy with the way it works. But, you decide to add a feature.

Now, when you write more code in `helloworld.cpp` there is a chance that the program which was working perfectly earlier, will stop working. You don't want to risk losing the earlier perfect code, so you make a copy of `helloworld.cpp` before you write more code into it.

Now you have two files. `helloworld-old.cpp` and `helloworld.cpp`.

If you add 5 more features, you might end up with 5 files.

## Git is a version controlling system ##

It automatically makes backups of all the ~~crime~~ code that you *commit*. It lets you *branch* out and explore new possibilities. (If it turns out that you didn't like what you added, you can just jump back to the main branch.)

## Install git ##
