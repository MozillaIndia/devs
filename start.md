## Welcome, hacker! ##

Becoming a developer is very easy.
Becoming a MahaDev takes some hard work.

If you are committed and curious, we'll help you reach there.

## How does it work? ##

In our day to day life at Mozilla we work on and come across a lot of bugs. Fixing them requires:

1. Knowledge
2. Time

And unfortunately, while many people have both of these, most people have only one. What do you do when you have a sock from one pair and another from a different pair? You pair what you have up.

And that's what we will do. We will put people who know how to fix things with people who have time to fix things. If all goes well, in some time, we'll have two people who know how to fix things and at least one with time to.

## Pre-requisites ##

The things you will definitely need are:

* curiosity,
* devoted time,
* a computer with access to Internet,
* a will to break things, and
* a will to learn how to fix them yourself.

 If you can promise us those, we promise you the elixir of programming.

## What we will do together ##

* Find bugs anywhere in Mozilla World.
* Figure out how to fix them.
* Fix them.
* Repeat.

## What you get ##

1. Coding skill
2. Open Badges
3. "MahaDev" title

## What MahaDevs get ##

1. Another MahaDev
2. Leadership skill
